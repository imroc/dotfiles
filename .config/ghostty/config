# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).
# 
# This does not work with GLFW builds.

# Valid values:
# 
#   * `true`
#   * `false` - windows won't have native decorations, i.e. titlebar and
#      borders. On macOS this also disables tabs and tab overview.
# 
# The "toggle_window_decoration" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.

# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.

# Horizontal window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells
# and the left and right window borders. The value is in points, meaning that
# it will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-x = 2,4` will set the
# left padding to 2 and the right padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-x = 2` will set both paddings to 2.

# Vertical window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells and
# the top and bottom window borders. The value is in points, meaning that it
# will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different top and bottom padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-y = 2,4` will set the
# top padding to 2 and the bottom padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-y = 2` will set both paddings to 2.
